# REDUX:
--------

* It is a predictable state container for JavaScript Applications.
* Redux stores the state of our entire application i.e. global state management.
* This will get rid of the problem of lifting the component's state and props drilling. 
* To explain clearly, say there are many components and multiple components need the same state, then state management becomes a pain in the ass. So Redux solves this issue by storing state for the entire application.

## React-Redux:
---------------

* React is a UI library and Redux is a state management library.
* In order for react to communicate with redux, we use an intermediate library called react-redux.
* react-redux is a redux UI binding library
