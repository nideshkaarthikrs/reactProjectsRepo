CONDTIONAL RENDERING:
---------------------

If the condition is true then we render something, else we render something else.
In other words, it is used to show or hide JSX or HTML based on some condition

We have 4 different approaches:
-------------------------------
1. if...else using JavaScript
2. Element variables
3. Ternary operator ?:
4. Short-ciruit operator (most commonly used)  && (logical and), || (logical or)
